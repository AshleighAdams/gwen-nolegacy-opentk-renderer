gwen-nolegacy-opentk-renderer
=============================
Fork of https://code.google.com/p/gwen-dotnet/

Adapted Gwen OpenTK Renderer to not use legacy OpenGL: Uses VBOs and shaders instead of client side vertex arrays and fixed function shading pipeline.

Original code is C++ written by Garry Newman.
